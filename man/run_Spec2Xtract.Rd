\arguments{
\item{files_dir}{path to the directory containing the
.raw files}

(\code{FALSE}) or only the first one (\code{TRUE}).}

inside a peak to keep it}

\item{ppm}{mass deviation for elemental composition
search in ppm}

\item{filter_irel}{Filter ions based on relative intensity}

\item{filter_isopurity}{Filter ions based on the isolation purity (from 0 to 100)}

\item{one_msp_file}{Boolean to combine all spectra to one unique .msp file \code{TRUE} or to
separate files \code{FALSE}}

\item{save_dir}{Directory to save tables}

\item{ncore}{Number of parallel workers}

\description{
This function run a full targets pipeline from
two paths: one to the directory containing .raw
files and one to the compound table.
